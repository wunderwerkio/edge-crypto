**Edge-Runtime compatible common crypto functions.**

This library implements commonly used cryptographic functions that are compatible with Edge-Runtime's Web Crypto API.

A lot of functionality is taken from [@hapi/cryptiles](https://github.com/hapijs/cryptiles), so credit goes to them for the actual implementation.
